# Stack Overflow Clone

A week 3 JavaScrpit independent project for Epicodus, this is intended to be a very basic version of Stack Overflow, to allow users to ask questions and search for relevant information based on limited criteria. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

##Specs

The full functionality of the site is not currently build out, but is more of a skeleton to reflect skills learned in the Angular module of the Epicodus JavaScript module. Future buildout could incloude full CRUD functionality to change models, more pipes for filtering data, and more interesting front-end graphical features. 

The goal of the site is to ask questions related to software development issues (or, theoretically, any other topic that the site owners/users may prefer). Users will be able to 

1. Ask a question
2. Answer a question
3. Search questions existing in the Firebase databases
4. Vote "up" or "down" to express user's opinion of answers
5. Login and "community" features, such as topic-related groups
